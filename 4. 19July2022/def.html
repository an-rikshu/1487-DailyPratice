        The seven islands that constitute Mumbai were earlier home to communities 
        of Marathi language speaking Koli people.[27][28][29] For centuries, the seven 
        islands of Bombay were under the control of successive indigenous rulers before being c
        eded to the Portuguese Empire, and subsequently to the East India Company in 1661, through t
        he dowry of Catherine Braganza when she was married off to Charles II of England.[30] During the 
        mid-18th century, Bombay was reshaped by the Hornby.
